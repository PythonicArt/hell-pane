Let me die in a heartbeat, not slow and steady
Let me die in my sleep when I’m good & ready
Let me die in the ocean, you can bury me at sea
Let me die in a coat train, you can burn my body

Let me die in the dessert, in the sea of sand
Let me die in the pleasure of a one night stand
Let me die in the forest with the first spring thaw
Let me die in the chorus, with a hallelujah

‘Cause I don’t wanna wake up losing altitude
I don’t want to wake up, whispering the blues
I don’t wanna wake up, what else can I do?
I don’t want to wake up if it ain’t next to you

Let me die in my new suit, I want to look my best
Let me die maybe real soon, I could use the rest
Let me die in a bar fight with a broken nose
Let me die in spotlight, you could pick my own pose

‘Cause I don’t wanna wake up losing altitude
I don’t want to wake up, whispering the blues
I don’t wanna wake up, what else can I do?
I don’t want to wake up if it ain’t next to you

When the trumpet sounds, (when the trumpet sounds)
They gon’na lay me down (they gon’na lay me down)
In a long white gown (in a long white gown)
Slowly lower me underground

Let me die on a Sunday for to stay outta hell
Let me die on the subway, could they even tell?
Let me die when the war ends, you could paint my face
Let me die in New Orleans, I wan’na march with ‘em saints

‘Cause I don’t wanna wake up losing altitude
I don’t want to wake up, whispering the blues
I don’t wanna wake up, what else can I do?
I don’t want to wake up if it ain’t next to you
I don’t want to wake up if it ain’t next to you
