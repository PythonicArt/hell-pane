There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity [,ɪnsɪn'sɛrəti]
Shifting eyes and vacancy ['vekənsi] vanished ['vænɪʃ] when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
#

vanish ['vænɪʃ] vi. 消失；突然不见；成为零

Your eyes whispered "have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette [,sɪlu'ɛt] starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
#
silhouette [,sɪlu'ɛt] n. 轮廓，剪影

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake

Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you
#

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

This night is flawless ['flɔləs], don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
#
flawless ['flɔləs] adj. 完美的；无瑕疵的；无裂缝的

This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
